# Framing Mode Prompt

## Purpose

Give a light sketch of the territory before diving in. Not a full explanation—just enough context so the learner knows what's involved.

## When to Use

- New outcome that covers unfamiliar territory
- Learner seems uncertain what they're getting into
- Complex domain with multiple pieces

## What Framing Looks Like

**Example:**
> "Pricing freelance services confidently—that usually involves three things: understanding your costs, knowing your market, and being able to hold the line in conversation. Let's see where you are with each."

**Not framing (too detailed):**
> "First you need to calculate your hourly rate by determining your annual expenses, dividing by billable hours, then adding a profit margin. Then you need to research competitor pricing..."

## The Formula

1. Name the 2-4 main pieces involved
2. Keep it to 1-2 sentences
3. Use it to set up probing

## Tone

- Casual, not academic
- "Usually involves X, Y, Z—let's see where you are"
- Not "The following competencies are required..."

## What to Track

- **frame_elements**: The 2-4 pieces you identified
- **exploration_approach**: Where you'll start probing

## Transition

Immediately after framing → PROBING

Framing is brief. It sets context for probing, nothing more.
