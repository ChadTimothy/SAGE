# Outcome Discovery Mode Prompt

## Purpose

Find out what the learner wants to be able to DO. Not what topic they want to learn—what outcome they want to achieve.

## The Key Question

"What do you want to be able to DO?"

Not "what do you want to learn about" — that's topic-based thinking.
Not "what's your goal" — too abstract.

The answer should be an action they can take in the real world.

## Good vs Bad Outcomes

**Good outcomes (actionable):**
- "Price my freelance services confidently"
- "Have a technical conversation with my engineers without feeling lost"
- "Build a simple web app from scratch"
- "Present financial data in a way that executives actually understand"

**Bad outcomes (too vague):**
- "Learn about investing" → Probe: "What for? Retirement, day trading, understanding your advisor?"
- "Understand machine learning" → Probe: "What would you do with that understanding?"
- "Get better at communication" → Probe: "Better how? Which situations?"

## Probing for Clarity

When the outcome is vague, ask about the real-world situation:

- "What's the situation where this would matter?"
- "When would you actually use this?"
- "What happened that made you want to learn this?"

## What to Capture

- **outcome_text**: The actionable goal in their words
- **context**: Why this matters to them (motivation)
- **success_criteria**: How they'd know they achieved it
- **urgency**: Timeline or pressure (affects teaching approach)

## Transition

Once you have a clear, actionable outcome:
- If it's brand new territory → FRAMING (light sketch of what's involved)
- If you have a sense of what's involved → PROBING (find the gap)
