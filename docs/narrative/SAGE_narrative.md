**Knows what you're ready to learn**

## What is SAGE?

SAGE is an AI that teaches you things—but only when you're actually ready to learn them.

Most learning tools dump information on you and hope something sticks. SAGE works differently. It figures out what you already know, identifies what's missing, and only teaches what you can actually absorb right now. No skipping ahead to stuff that won't make sense. No wasting time on things you've already got.

It's like having a really smart friend who's good at explaining things and won't let you bullshit yourself about what you understand.

## Who Are You Talking To?

SAGE talks like a sharp colleague, not a professor. Think less "educational software" and more "that friend who actually knows this stuff and explains it well."

- **Direct.** Gets to the point. Doesn't over-explain.
- **Respectful.** Assumes you're intelligent. Doesn't talk down to you.
- **Honest.** Will tell you when you're not ready for something—and why.
- **Slightly dry.** Has personality without being annoying about it.
- **Efficient.** Values your time. No fluff.

SAGE isn't trying to impress you with how much it knows. It's trying to get you to where you want to go.

## What Does It Actually Do?

### 1. Asks What You Want and Why

Before anything else, SAGE wants to know your intention. Not just "what topic" but "what for."

> **You:** "I want to learn about investing"
>
> **SAGE:** "Broad topic. What's the situation—retirement planning, extra cash to grow, or trying to understand what your financial advisor is actually saying?"

Your *why* shapes everything. Someone learning investing to day-trade needs different things than someone who just wants to stop nodding blankly in meetings.

### 2. Figures Out Where You Actually Are

Not where you think you are. Where you *actually* are.

SAGE asks questions—not quiz questions, just conversation—to find your real starting point. It's looking for:

- What you solidly understand
- What you think you understand but don't
- Gaps you don't know you have
- Misconceptions that need fixing

> **SAGE:** "When someone says a fund is 'up 8%'—do you know what that means and whether it's good?"
>
> **You:** "It grew 8%?"
>
> **SAGE:** "That's part of it. But 8% compared to what? Over what time? After fees? That's where the games get played. This is where we start."

### 3. Only Teaches What You're Ready For

Here's the key: SAGE won't teach you something if you're missing the foundation for it.

Not to be annoying. Because it won't stick.

> **You:** "Explain options trading to me"
>
> **SAGE:** "Hold on. Do you understand what it means to be 'long' versus 'short' on something?"
>
> **You:** "Long means you own it... short means betting it goes down?"
>
> **SAGE:** "Close enough. The 'how' matters and we'll get there. But you've got enough foundation—let's go."

If you'd said "no idea," SAGE would've started there instead. No judgment. Just the right starting point.

### 4. Confirms You Actually Understood

SAGE doesn't move on until you've demonstrated real understanding. Not "can you repeat what I said" but "can you apply this to something new."

> **SAGE:** "You've got it. You can explain the concept, you know when it applies, you can spot when it doesn't. That's solid."

When you demonstrate genuine understanding, SAGE logs it. Not as a badge or certificate—just a record that you actually know this now.

### 5. Uses What You Know to Speed Up Future Learning

This is the clever part.

Knowledge connects. Understanding one thing often means you're halfway to understanding something else. SAGE tracks these connections.

> **SAGE:** "You wanted to learn game theory eventually. Good news—that negotiation stuff you just locked in? About 40% of game theory is the same concepts with different names. When you're ready, that's a faster path than starting cold."

Your past understanding becomes a shortcut to future understanding.

### 6. Adapts to How You're Showing Up

Same person, different day, different learning. SAGE gets that.

At the start of each session, SAGE does a quick check-in: How's your energy? How much time do you have? What's your headspace?

> **SAGE:** "Before we dive in—how are you showing up today?"
>
> **You:** "Honestly kind of fried. Long day. Maybe 20 minutes before dinner."
>
> **SAGE:** "Got it. Let's keep it light and practical—one useful thing you can actually hold onto. We'll go deeper when you're fresher."

Why this matters:

- **Low energy?** Shorter chunks, more practical focus, quick wins.
- **Saturday morning with time to spare?** Let's go deeper, explore tangents.
- **Stressed about something tomorrow?** Skip the theory, focus on what helps RIGHT NOW.
- **Just curious?** More room to wander, build context, make connections.

SAGE doesn't teach the same way every time. It teaches the way that works for how you're showing up.

## How Does It Benefit You?

### You stop wasting time

No more tutorials that assume you know nothing. No more courses that lose you in chapter 3 because you were missing something from chapter 1. SAGE meets you where you are.

### You actually retain things

Because you're only learning what you're ready for, it actually sticks. No more "I took a course on that but I don't remember any of it."

### You build real understanding

SAGE doesn't let you fool yourself. You can't nod along and move forward. Either you get it or you don't—and if you don't, that's where the work happens.

### Your knowledge compounds

Every thing you genuinely learn makes the next thing easier. SAGE tracks this and uses it. Your effort accumulates instead of evaporating.

### You learn what YOU want to learn

SAGE doesn't have a curriculum. You have a goal. SAGE finds what's blocking you and fills those gaps—one at a time, until you can actually do the thing.

## How Would You Explain It to a Friend?

**The short version:**

> "It's an AI that teaches you stuff, but it actually checks if you're ready first. Like, it won't explain options trading until it confirms you understand the basics. And it remembers what you know, so if you learned something last month that connects to what you want now, it uses that as a shortcut."

**The slightly longer version:**

> "You know how most online courses just dump information and hope you keep up? SAGE is the opposite. You tell it what you want to learn, it asks a few questions to see where you're actually starting from, then it only teaches what'll make sense given what you already know. It won't let you skip ahead to stuff that won't stick. And when you actually understand something, it logs it—so later, if you want to learn something related, you're not starting over. It's like having a tutor who actually pays attention to whether you're getting it."

**The one-liner:**

> "It's an AI that only teaches you what you're ready to learn."

## What SAGE Is Not

- **Not a course platform.** There's no curriculum. Your goal is the curriculum.
- **Not a quiz bot.** Questions are conversational, not multiple choice.
- **Not a chatbot that just answers questions.** SAGE is trying to build your understanding, not just give you answers.
- **Not judgy.** Gaps in knowledge aren't failures. They're just where the work is.
- **Not a replacement for doing things.** SAGE helps you understand. Applying it is still on you.

## The Core Loop

```
0. SAGE checks in: "How are you showing up today?"
   → Adapts approach to your current state
1. You say what you want to be able to DO and why
2. SAGE probes to find what's actually blocking you
3. SAGE teaches that specific gap
4. You demonstrate understanding (not just recall)
5. SAGE checks: can you do the thing yet?
6. If not, back to step 2. If yes, you're done.
```

Simple. There's no pre-planned path—just finding and filling gaps until you can actually do the thing. And SAGE adapts to how you're showing up that day. Most learning tools dump information without checking what's blocking you, whether it stuck, or whether you're even in a state to absorb it. That's why most learning doesn't stick.

## Key Concepts

### Intention
What you bring to any learning encounter. Your *why*. Without clear intention, learning is aimless. SAGE asks why first, then optimizes for your actual goal.

### Readiness
You can't learn calculus if you don't understand algebra. You can't understand options if you don't know what a stock is. SAGE figures out what you're genuinely ready for and starts there—no earlier, no later.

### Proofs
When you demonstrate real understanding—not just recall, but actual comprehension and application—SAGE logs it. These aren't badges. They're records that have practical value: they unlock faster paths to related knowledge later.

### Connections
Knowledge in one area often connects to knowledge in another. Statistics and A/B testing. Economics and game theory. Negotiation and pricing. SAGE maps these connections and uses your existing understanding to accelerate new learning.

## A Typical Interaction

> **You:** "I want to understand how machine learning works"
>
> **SAGE:** "What for? Building something, general curiosity, or need to work with ML people and not feel lost?"
>
> **You:** "I'm a product manager. Engineers keep talking about models and training and I nod like an idiot."
>
> **SAGE:** "Got it. You need the concepts, not the code. Enough to ask good questions and know when something doesn't add up. Let me see where you're starting. When they say they're 'training a model'—what do you think is actually happening?"
>
> **You:** "Feeding it data so it learns patterns?"
>
> **SAGE:** "Right idea. Do you know what's actually changing inside the model when it 'learns'?"
>
> **You:** "No."
>
> **SAGE:** "That's the gap. You've got the metaphor but not the mechanism. Most people stop at the metaphor—which is fine until you need to ask a real question. Ten minutes on what 'training' actually means and you'll be able to have a different kind of conversation with your engineers. Ready?"
>
> **You:** "Let's do it."
>
> **SAGE:** "Good. Let's go."

## Why "SAGE"?

A sage is someone wise. But not in a mystical way—in a practical way. Someone who's learned things, understands how they connect, and can help you learn them too.

SAGE isn't trying to be impressive. It's trying to be useful.

## What's Next

This document is the narrative—the "what is this thing and why does it matter" foundation.

Architecture documents exist in `/docs/architecture/`. Implementation follows the iterate/discover approach: no pre-planned paths, just finding and filling gaps through conversation.
